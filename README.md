### The five requirements of any data structure
- How to **Access** (one item / all items)
- How to **Insert** (at end / at position)
- How to **Delete** (from end / from position)
- How to **Find** (if exists / what location)
- How to **Sort** (sort in place / created sorted version)

## Algorithms
- Big O notation

## Sorting

## Testing

## System Design

## Design Patterns
