## Arrays
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

### Arrays in Java 
[Source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arrays-in-java/)

   - In Java all arrays are dynamically allocated.
   - A Java array variable can also be declared like other variables with [] after the data type.
   - The variables in the array are ordered and each have an index beginning from 0.
   - Java array can be also be used as a static field, a local variable or a method parameter.
   - The size of an array must be specified by an int value and not long or short.
   - The direct superclass of an array type is Object.
   - Every array type implements the interfaces Cloneable and java.io.Serializable.

### Two-Dimentional Array
### Multi-Dimentional Array (Jagged Array)

## Linked Lists
A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

### Singly linked list
Item navigation is forward only.

### Doubly linked list
Items can be navigated forward and backward.

### Circular linked list
Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.

### Basic Operations
- Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.
- Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.
- Display − Displays the complete list.
- Search − Searches an element using the given key.
- Delete − Deletes an element using the given key.
