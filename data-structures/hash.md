# Hash Tables
A.K.A. *hash, hash map, map, unordered map, dictionary*

### Strengths:
- **Fast lookups** - Lookups take *O(1)* time on *average*.
- **Flexible keys** - Most data types can be used for keys, as long as they're hashable. 

### Weaknesses:
- **Slow worst-case lookups** - Lookups take *O(n)* time in the worst case.
- **Unordered** - Keys aren't stored in a special order. If you're looking for the smallest key, the largest key, or all the keys in a range, you'll need to look through every key to find it.
- **Single-directional lookups** - While you can look up the value for a given key in *O(1)* time, looking up the keys for a given value requires looping through the whole datasetâ€”O(n)O(n)O(n) time.
- **Not cache-friendly** - Many hash table implementations use linked lists, which don't put data next to each other in memory.

| . | Average | Worst Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| space 	| O(n) | O(n) |
| insert |	O(1) | O(n) |
| lookup |	O(1) | O(n) |
| delete |	O(1) | O(n) |

## Basic Operations
### Search
Searches an element in a hash table.

### Insert
Inserts an element in a hash table.

### Delete
Deletes an element from a hash table.
