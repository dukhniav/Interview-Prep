# Trees

Trees represent nodes connected by edges.

### Binary Tree

This is the most basic basic from of tree structure. Where each node can have utmost two children.

#### **Perfect** binary tree
Binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children __and__ all leaves have the same __depth__ or same __level__.

#### **Full** binary tree
(sometimes referred to as a proper[15] or plane binary tree) 
A tree in which every node in the tree has either 0 or 2 children. 

#### **Complete** binary tree
Every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.

#### **Infinite complete** binary tree
Every node has two children.

### Binary Search Tree

### AVL Tree/ Height Balanced Binary Tree

### Red-Black Tree
