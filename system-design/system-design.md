# Systems Design Interview

## Concurrency
- Threads
- Deadlock
- Starvation

- Parallelizing algorithms

- Consistency
- Coherence

## Networking
- IPC
- TCP/IP
- Throuphput
- Latency

## Abstraction
- Roughly how an OS, file system, and database works?
- Various levels of caching 

## Real-World Performance
- Relative performance of RAM, disk, SSD, and network.

## Estimation
Estimation, especially in the form of a back-of-the-envelope calculation, is important because it helps you narrow down the list of possible solutions to only the ones that are feasible. Then you have only a few prototypes or micro-benchmarks to write.
